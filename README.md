Note: Ctrl + F5 to reload page

Another Note: playlist.html is something I will get from the music platform to find 
if the song exists (maybe with an API call)

Note to self: When loading vite, you will need to add /app/ to the localhost

Having trouble with componentizing/stylizing index, I tried componentizing the list with pictures but it wouldn't redirect to the right page. 
I also wasn't able to get to part 4 of the assignment, I will try to do better on the next assignment.
