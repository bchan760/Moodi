Note: Ctrl + F5 to reload page

Another Note: playlist.html is something I will get from the music platform to find 
if the song exists (maybe with an API call)

Note to self: When loading vite, you will need to add /app/ to the localhost

Single Page App:
Reason why I chose this format - user interaction with the app primarily is staying on one page, but dynamically changes depending on the user's action. I also don't want the user to keep refreshing the page in order to select something (i.e. a random song).
